# Final_Project-Call_Your_Mother

# Objectives: 

Final Project option number 41 doing the project option Call your Mother. The purpose of the project is to make sure the user is keeping up with their family and give reminders when certain contacts have not been called recently.

# Tasks:
Create Notifications that track the amount of time between calls of different contacts. (Check back to the lectures about Notifications and Phone Number/Contact tracking)

Notifications should track in real time to figure out how much time has passed since the last call and maybe the amount of time spent on the call. Notifications/Reminders can be based on the amount of time total spent on call with a contact or the amount of time since the last call.

Create a Form that takes in a contact and sets the amount of times they should be calling them per week, month, or year or the amount of time spent with on the phone with a contact each week, month, or year.


# Optional:
Track the patterns of calls when they are keeping up with their family well and send a nice notification that says they have been doing a good job.
